            Hello, I'm Stuart Wong.  Welcome to my professional portfolio.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a Full Stack Developer with a Bachelor’s degree in psychology, educated at UCLA.  I recently earned a certificate in full stack web development from UCLA Extension, with newly developed skills in Javascript, JQuery, Node.js and React.js.  Known as an extremely hard worker fascinated by solving new problems, my aim is to develop apps that are intuitive and user-friendly.  I recently worked with a team of four to develop an HTML5 game using a physics engine in two weeks.  Passionate about learning new skills, my goal is to create innovative apps that push the boundaries of the web development world.  I’m excited to become a member of a fast-paced, quality-driven team that can help me expand my knowledge.

            Now, a little about myself:  I was born in Los Angeles, CA and still live here; in West LA.  I live with my girlfriend and two dogs.  I am currently unemployed and training to be a full-stack web developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            My hobbies include sports like basketball and softball.  I also like outdoor activities like hiking and rock climbing.  I currently spend a lot of time indoors playing video games and practicing coding during the quarantine.  I cannot wait to get outside again and go for a hike with my dogs!
