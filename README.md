This is my personal, professional website to showcase my portfolio. I built this website to showcase all the projects that I've worked on.

There is a main page (index), portfolio page and contact page. I made sure there is a navbar that is consistent on each page.  I also have working links throughout the entire site, but the contact page is not yet fully functional.

I utilized Bootstrap so that the layout and all of the images are responsive.  I made sure that every section is inside a container so that the layout will transition seemlessly throughout each different viewport.  I wanted to write the entire site without using any additional CSS Stylesheets to show my comprehension of Bootstrap.  I did however use some inline styling change the aesthetics, but this I tried to minimize.

I do also want to note that I did not use any of my own media queries, knowing that they are already built into Bootstrap.

Thank you for visiting my site.
